# STOLEN - uSeful bioinformaTics cOmmandLine codE sNippets
STOLEN is a collection of self-written code snippets that turned out to be useful in the everyday life of a bioinformatician.


## Code snippets
* **batch_correct.py**: Corrects RNA expression data from different sources for potential batch effects using pyComBat.
* **merge_megsap_expression_files.py**: Merge RNA count files from megSAP into one TSV file containing TPM values.
* **remove_duplicate_read_names.py:** Removes duplicate read names from a fastq.gz file. Abundant reads with the same name will be discarded.
* **prepare_strelka_for_pvacseq.py:** Adds annotations that are neccessary for the pVACseq neoantigen prediction pipeline to Strelka2 VCF files.
